--[[ Equadis' Classic Overhaul :: hud

  The driver. Binds modules to slots, routes events, and owns the single
  OnUpdate.

  Modules never draw from an event handler. They mutate their own state and call
  OB.SetDirty; the redraw is batched here on the next frame. That is ShaguDPS's
  dirty-flag decoupling applied to a HUD, and it is why a module that only
  changes on an event -- combo points, health -- costs nothing per frame.
  RogueBars recomputed every bar every frame regardless.

     A **bar module** is given a rectangle in the cluster and draws into it. A
     **feature module** -- the threat meter, the damage meter -- owns a window of
     its own, decides its own size and position, and has nothing to do with the
     stack. So the binder cannot find it by walking barOrder, because it occupies
     no bar, and it must not be handed a bar frame it did not ask for.

     What it shares is everything else: the event map, the dirty-flag redraw, the
     per-module enable flag, the class gate. That sharing is the point -- a
     feature gets the same dispatch a bar gets, so the parts of it that tick and
     redraw are somebody else's problem. ]]--
