# Atlas‑CFM (Destination Click fork) — Documentation (WoW 1.12)

> **This is a fork of Atlas‑CFM that changes what clicking a transport marker on the World Map does.**
>
> In the original addon, clicking a boat, zeppelin, or tram icon opened the Atlas "Transport Routes"
> page — a map with lines connecting every port. In this fork:
>
> - **Left-click** a transport icon → the World Map switches to the zone that route travels to.
> - **Right-click** a transport icon → opens the Atlas Transport Routes page (the original behaviour).
>
> Details:
> - Applies to boat, zeppelin, and tram markers only. Dungeon, raid, and world boss markers are
>   unchanged: left-click still opens the corresponding Atlas map, and right-click still zooms the
>   World Map out as usual.
> - Destinations are zones, because that is the granularity of the 1.12 World Map. The Menethil
>   Harbor boat, for example, takes the map to the Wetlands, where the return marker is visible.
> - The marker tooltip shows both actions, e.g. `Left-click: Tirisfal Glades` and
>   `Right-click: Transport Routes`, so the next destination is always visible before you click.
> - Route destinations live in the `dest` field of each transport entry in
>   `CFMAtlas/AtlasMapMarkers.lua`, and respect the selected server specialization (TurtleWoW,
>   Vanilla+, Classic), so each server only sees its own routes.
>
> Everything else below is inherited from upstream Atlas‑CFM and behaves the same.

  - `Locales/[locale]/` — Language-specific files (enUS, deDE, esES, ptBR, zhCN)
  - Each locale has 9 modules: Core, Zones, Bosses, Classes, Factions, Spells, ItemSets, MapData, QuestData
- Automatic fallback to English for missing translations
- To add/update translations: edit the corresponding file in `Locales/[locale]/`

12) Technical Details
- No external Babble libraries required (replaced by modular system)
- All localization data is loaded via `Locales/locales.xml`
