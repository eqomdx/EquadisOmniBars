--[[ Equadis' Classic Overhaul :: render

  The bar and segment factories, and everything that paints them.

  Nothing here knows what a slot contains or which module is drawing. A module
  asks for a bar, hands it a fraction, and gets a bar filled to that fraction.

  One rule governs this whole file, and it is the most important constraint in
  the codebase (RogueBars HANDOFF section 5.2):

      A bar draws its own fill texture. The StatusBar widget's built-in fill is
      never used for anything partial or reversed.

  Vanilla 1.12 has no SetReverseFill, and the widget re-lays its texture out
  internally on a schedule Lua cannot see, so anything set from here is applied
  inconsistently and shows up as stretched art or gaps. Three separate attempts
  to work around that failed in three different ways.

  RogueBars kept combo points on the native fill because they are always drawn
  at 100%, and its own handover notes flagged that as a trap waiting to be
  sprung. Here every bar owns a fill without exception, and the frames are plain
  Frames rather than StatusBars -- with no native fill in the object at all, the
  rule cannot be broken by accident.

--[[ **The look, for one subsystem or for all of them.**

     Texture, font, font size, outline and border are the five settings that make
     five separate addons look like five separate addons. They belong to the
     profile, so setting them once sets them everywhere -- that is the whole
     premise of this addon and it is the reason they were global from the start.

     A subsystem may still disagree. Nameplates want a smaller font than a HUD
     bar does, and a damage meter's rows want a flatter texture than a health
     bar. So each carries the same five keys and a switch, and the switch is on
     by default: **share the look unless you say otherwise.**

     One accessor rather than each module reading the profile itself, because the
     override has to be checked in the same place every time. A module that read
     `OB.profile.texture` directly would be right until somebody used the
     override, and then wrong in exactly one place nobody would look. ]]--

--[[ Lay the segments out edge to edge across the slot.

     The segment width is floored to a whole pixel so the row sits flush with no
     sub-pixel overlap. When a border is on, the segments are spaced apart inside
     the same total width -- otherwise each point's border stacks on its
     neighbour's, which reads as a double-thick line between them.

     `shown` lays out fewer than were built and hides the rest, so one frame set
     can serve a shape not known until runtime -- 1.12 does not really allow
     creating and destroying frames mid-session, so the maximum is built once and
     the surplus is parked.

     Nothing passes it today. The distance readout did, back when it drew four
     bands on one client and a single continuous bar on another; it draws one bar
     coloured by state on every client now, so combo points -- always five -- is
     the only caller left. Kept because the cost is one `or` and the alternative
     is discovering the constraint again the next time a module wants a count it
     cannot know at load. ]]--
