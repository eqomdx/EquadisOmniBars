--[[ Equadis' Classic Overhaul :: chat commands

  **A slash command is a keybinding you can type**, and 1.12 gives you one of
  those and not the other. The Key Bindings panel has a hundred and forty
  entries -- Toggle Walk, Sit, Sheath Weapon, Toggle Music -- and every one of
  them is a thing you might rather type than find a spare key for.

  So: any of them can be bound to a command of your own naming. `/walk`, `/sit`,
  `/x` if that is what you want it called.

  **Two kinds of thing can be behind a command**, and the difference is worth
  keeping:

  - a **binding**, which is one of the client's own, named exactly as the Key
    Bindings panel names it. These are the "bind anything" half.
  - a **builtin**, which is one of this addon's, because the client has no
    binding for it or because the useful version does more than the binding
    does. `/fps` reports latency as well as framerate; `/hud` has to move the
    chat frame out from under the interface it is hiding, or you cannot type
    the command that brings it back.

  Both live in one list, because from the outside they are the same thing: a
  word you type that does something.

  **The shipped set is seeded once and then it is yours.** Delete `/fps` and it
  stays deleted -- `chatCommandsSeeded` in the account store is what makes that true.
  A list that refilled itself on login would not be a list you could edit.

  Ported in part from Equadis' Chat Tweaks' Commands module, which is where
  `/fps`, `/hud`, `/sheath`, `/autorun`, `/combatlog` and `/walk` come from and
  where the chat-watcher trick was worked out.

--[[ **1.12 has no way to invoke a binding by name.**

     The Key Bindings panel lists commands -- `TOGGLERUN`, `SITORSTAND` -- and
     the client holds the Lua for each one internally, keyed to a key. There is
     no `RunBinding` in vanilla to reach it with. Later clients grew one and some
     private servers have back-ported it, so it is tried first and guarded.

     Failing that, each binding is run through the API it is defined in terms
     of. That is not a workaround so much as the same thing said twice: the
     client's `TOGGLERUN` binding *is* a call to `ToggleRun`.

     **Every entry is a function rather than a name**, so a binding that takes an
     argument -- the character sheet wants to know which tab -- is written the
     way it actually reads instead of needing a second column nothing else
     uses. ]]--

     box is open, and put back afterwards.

     either, or its OnUpdate stops with the rest of the interface. That is the
