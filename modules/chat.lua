--[[ Equadis' Classic Overhaul :: chat

  Ported from Equadis' Chat Tweaks, which is Prat-V, which is Prat -- by Curney
  and Krtek, inspired by idChat2. See NOTICE; the line-level work in these
  behaviours is theirs.

  **What is not ported is the whole reason this is small.** Prat ships nine Ace2
  libraries -- AceAddon, AceDB, AceConsole, AceEvent, AceHook, AceLocale,
  AceModuleCore, AceOO, AceTab -- and every one of them does a job this addon
  already does: a module registry, a profile store, an event map, a slash prompt.
  Nine thousand three hundred lines of it, replaced rather than carried.

  **And the settings become an interface for free.** Prat is usually described as
  configured "through chat", which is not quite right: each module *declares* its
  settings as a table, and Ace2 rendered that as chat commands only because Ace2
  had no panel. The declarations were always there. Re-declaring them in this
  addon's own options format is what turns them into a page -- no settings UI is
  written here, the same generator that builds every other tab builds this one.

  Timestamps first, because it is self-contained, has real settings and touches
  the one thing every other chat module will also need: a hook on AddMessage.

--[[ **Breadcrumbs, because the client will not say where a file died.**

     `/console scriptErrors 1` does nothing on this client, so a file that
     throws while loading takes its module with it and leaves no message. What
     the client *does* do is carry on with the next file -- so anything this one
     wrote before it died survives, and the last number written says how far it
     got.

     nil means the file never compiled: a syntax error, which on 1.12 means
     something Lua 5.0 rejects and 5.1 accepts. Any number means it started, and
     which number says where it stopped. `/eqob doctor` reports it. ]]--

--[[ 1.12 has seven chat windows, and the number is fixed rather than discovered:
     NUM_CHAT_WINDOWS exists but a stub or a future client could disagree with
     the frames that actually exist, and a hook on a missing frame is an error
     rather than a no-op. ]]--
local WINDOWS = 7



--[[ A formatted time, with the padding the client insists on taken back off.

     **Only a leading zero, and only at the front.** "09:05" becomes "9:05" and
     "10:05" is left alone -- a blunter substitution would turn "10:05" into
     "1:5", which is not a time. `stripAll` unpads the later fields the same way,
     which is what an unpadded shape asks for: `h:m` at five past nine is "9:5",
     because that is what the notation says. ]]--
function OB.FormatTime(spec, when)
    local text = when and date(spec[1], when) or date(spec[1])

    if spec.strip then

    end

    return text
end




--[[ **Three questions instead of one list of twelve.**

     Twelve entries was every combination of three independent choices written
     out, which is what a list becomes when the things behind it are orthogonal:
     the reader has to find their answer in a set rather than give it. Worse,
     several of the twelve differed only after ten in the morning, so the list
     could not be read at all without knowing what time it was.

     The three questions are: twelve-hour or twenty-four, is there a meridiem,
     and how much of the clock with how much padding. AM/PM is greyed rather
     than hidden when the answer is twenty-four hours, because it is still your
     answer -- it just has nothing to attach to. ]]--

OB.chatJustify = { "LEFT", "CENTER", "RIGHT" }

--[[ What a numbered channel is reduced to. `[1. General]` becomes `[1]`, or
     `[General]`, or `[G]` -- all three are in use and none is obviously right,
     which is what makes it a setting rather than a decision. ]]--

--[[ How a name is coloured.

     Class is the one people want. Random is Prat's answer to the rest: hash the
     name into a colour, so the same person is the same colour every time even
     when nobody knows what they are. It is not pretty and it is genuinely
     useful in a channel full of strangers. ]]--
--[[ **Declared here, above the module, and that is not tidiness.**

     The options table is built when `RegisterModule` runs, so a list referenced
     from a row has to exist by then. This one was declared beside the code that
     uses it, four-fifths of the way down the file -- so the row was handed nil,
     the dropdown built no buttons, and it opened onto nothing.

     Two wire formats exist because two addons invented one each. The names are
     theirs, and they are what the people reading you have to be able to
     decode. ]]--

             these windows are read as prose rather than glanced at as numbers,
             and the client's own Friz Quadrata is a headline face doing a body
             job. So the row is here rather than in the five-row appearance
             block, which chat does not carry.

             It still goes through `OB.Look`, so leaving it alone means leaving
             it wherever the profile's font is -- share unless you say
             otherwise, the same rule as everywhere else. ]]--
