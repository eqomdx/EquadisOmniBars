--[[ Equadis' Classic Overhaul :: swing timers

  Main hand and off hand, as two module ids over one implementation table. A
  third (swing_ranged) drops in the same way once the ranged timer lands.

  Swing tracking is a data source rather than a renderer, so it runs on its own
  event frame instead of on either module. Hanging it off swing_main would break
  the off-hand bar the moment someone emptied the main hand slot, and having both
  modules register the same events would attribute every swing twice.

     "Ready longest" -- largest overdue value -- and NOT "closest to its due
     time". When anything stops the swings for a while (a stun, a knockdown,
     running out of range, facing away) both hands end up overdue by different
     amounts. Ranking by distance from due lets the less-overdue hand win every
     single comparison, so the other hand is never re-anchored and its bar stays
     pinned at 100% forever. Ranking by most-overdue always re-anchors the
     starved hand first, so the pair recovers on its own within a swing or two.

     CHAT_MSG_SPELL_SELF_DAMAGE carries every spell the player lands, not just

     this phase can read -- recovering that needs the localisation-aware parser
     Phase 3 brings. So the event is filtered by *timing* instead: an auto shot
     can only land at the end of its own cycle, and anything arriving early in
     the cycle is some other spell and must not move the anchor.

     Three quarters of a cycle is the threshold. Too strict and a shot fired at a
     moving target never re-anchors; too loose and an instant cast fired while
     the shot is pending drags the bar backwards. Getting it wrong is
     self-correcting either way -- the next START_AUTOREPEAT_SPELL re-seeds --
