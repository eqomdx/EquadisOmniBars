--[[ Equadis' Classic Overhaul :: roster

  **What the addon knows about other players, and how it finds out.**

  The store itself is in config.lua, at the root of the saved variables rather
  than inside a profile, for the reason given there: "Grimtusk is a level 60
  warrior" is a fact about the world and not a setting your rogue might disagree
  with. This module is everything that writes to it.

  Two halves. The first is passive and free -- the client hands over a guild
  roster, a friends list, a raid, and each of those is a list of people whose
  class and level are right there. Prat's PlayerNames did this and the readers
  below are its readers.

  The second half is the part Prat had no answer for: **most of the names in
  General and World belong to nobody you have ever grouped with**, so the passive
  half never learns them and they stay uncoloured forever. The only way to find
  out is to ask, and the only thing to ask with is `/who`.

  Kept separate from the chat module on purpose. Chat *shows* what is known;
  this decides what is known. Nameplates and unit frames will want the same
  answers, and neither of them should have to switch a chat module on to get
  them.

     There were three shapes on a dropdown -- level, level-and-class, and zone --
     and the choice was not one anybody could make, because two of the three are
     strictly worse. Level-and-class is five hundred and forty queries and three
     hours to avoid an overflow that happens at a handful of levels. Zone finds
     whoever is standing somewhere, which means it misses instances and anywhere
     this addon has not heard of, and it cannot be reconciled with the level
     sweep afterwards.

     So there is one shape. Sixty levels, each on its own. A level that answers
     with the cap has not answered -- fifty is a limit, not a count -- and that
     level alone is asked again once per class, which cannot overflow on any
     realm anybody plays on. See `Split`.
