--[[ Equadis' Classic Overhaul :: threat meter

  Who has the aggro, and how close you are to taking it.

  The first **feature** module: it owns a window rather than a bar in the
  cluster, so it is bound by hud.lua's feature path and is listed on the Modules
  page. Everything else it shares with the bars -- the event map, the dirty-flag
  redraw, the profile, the media, the options panel.

  Ported from Equadis' Threat Meter, which this supersedes. Two things about that
  port are worth knowing before changing anything here.

  **The data is given, not derived.** Turtle broadcasts threat to the party over
  the addon channel as a single packet with a `TWTv4=` prefix, and this reads it.
  There is no combat log parsing anywhere in this file, which is why the threat
  meter did not have to wait for the parser the damage meter needs -- and why
  none of this works on a server that does not send the packet. It says so rather
  than showing an empty window.

  **The packet is the whole protocol**, so parsing it is the only thing that has
  to be exactly right. It is separated from everything that draws for that
  reason: OB.ParseThreatPacket is a pure function over a string, and the tests
  drive it directly with packets rather than through a window.

--[[ **The question the meter could not answer: how much threat does *this* cost?**

     The window says where everybody stands. It has never said what to stop doing
     about it -- and the answer to "I keep pulling" is almost always one ability
     rather than all of them.

     Nothing in the game will tell you. There is no threat-per-spell API, the
     packet carries totals only, and the published coefficients are a wiki page
     that is wrong for half the abilities on a private server.

     **So it is measured.** The packet gives your total threat twice a second;
     the combat log says what you did in between. When exactly one thing happened
     in a window, the change in threat belongs to that one thing.

     A window with two events in it teaches nothing and is thrown away. That
     sounds wasteful and is not: a rotation produces a great many single-event
     windows at two packets a second, and one clean sample is worth more than
     five apportioned by a model nobody checked.
